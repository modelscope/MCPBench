Her White House tenure demonstrates how a very reluctant and bereaved First Lady coped with her duties, often by relying on surrogate hostesses . Jane possessed many of the traits associated with the ideal for women of her time. She was delicate and spiritual, and she desired to remain in her own domestic sphere, away from the often coarse political world of her husband. Early Life Born March 12, 1806, in Hampton, New Hampshire, Jane was the third of six children of the Reverend Jesse Appleton and Elizabeth Means Appleton. Jane’s father was a Congregational minister and president of Bowdoin College in Maine. Following his death in 1819, the family went to live with her mother’s wealthy relatives. Petite, dark-haired Jane was both well educated for her day and devout. In the 1820’s, she attended Catharine Fiske’s Young Ladies Seminary in Keene, New Hampshire. Marriage and Family Franklin Pierce attended Bowdoin College in the early 1820’s with Jane’s brother William. There he was educated by her future brother-in-law, Alpheus Packard. Although Franklin was the son of a Revolutionary War hero, Jane’s family objected to her marrying him. While he was a Democrat, the Appletons were Federalists, and they did not consider his tavern-owning family their equals. After a long courtship and his election to the U.S. Congress, the gregarious Franklin finally married shy Jane on November 19, 1834, in Amherst, New Hampshire. Franklin whisked Jane away from the shelter of rich relations to the roughness of Washington, D.C. Legislators of the time lived in boardinghouses, and this “mess” life challenged frail Jane. Living conditions were often crude and uncomfortable, and politics dominated daily life. During the miserable, hot summer months in Washington, Jane’s health suffered. She was often sickly and melancholy, even before a series of tragedies beset her and her husband. In 1835 Jane left Washington to stay with her mother and other relatives. The Pierces’ first son, Franklin Pierce Jr., was born in February 1836, but he lived only three days. The next year Jane returned to Washington with Franklin following his election to the Senate. Two more sons were born: Frank Robert in August 1839 and Benjamin in April 1841. Jane came to oppose Franklin’s political pursuits. The heavy drinking of other politicians, she felt, aggravated her husband’s problems with alcohol. Jane observed, “Oh, how I wish he was out of political life! How much better it would be for him on every account!” In 1842 she persuaded Franklin to resign from the Senate and come home to Concord, New Hampshire, where he would be close to his family and away fr\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://www.ebsco.com/themes/custom/cog_ebsco/images/favicon.ico\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Pierce\",\n      \"title\": \"Jane Pierce - Wikipedia\",\n      \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Pierce\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-03-29T23:25:55.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\",\n      \"text\": \"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \\n \\n Jane Pierce Pierce in 1857 First Lady of the United States In role March 4, 1853 – March 4, 1857 President Franklin Pierce Preceded by Abigail Fillmore Succeeded by Harriet Lane (acting) Personal details Born Jane Means Appleton March 12, 1806 Hampton, New Hampshire , U.S. Died December 2, 1863 (aged 57) Andover, Massachusetts , U.S. Resting place Old North Cemetery Spouse \\n Franklin Pierce ​ ( m. ) ​ Children 3 Parent(s) Jesse Appleton Elizabeth Means Signature \\n Jane Means Pierce ( née Appleton ; March 12, 1806 – December 2, 1863) was the first lady of the United States from 1853 to 1857, being married to Franklin Pierce , the 14th president of the United States .\\n Born in Hampton, New Hampshire , she married Pierce, then a congressman, in 1834 despite her family's misgivings.

Her parents were James Ballou and Mehitable Ingalls. Her father was a talented mathematician and clairvoyant, known as “James the Astrologer.” He ran a public house before his sudden death after a fall in his barn in April, 1808. Her mother Mehitable was described as a plucky, red-haired woman and a skillful weaver. Eliza was described as unusually attractive, petite, sprightly, industrious, intelligent, and a tireless spirit of activity. Eliza became acquainted with her future husband, Abram Garfield, when asking him for directions. She denied any interest in the “green boy,” but was soon smitten with the strong, handsome man Abram had become. He and her sister Hitty were promised to each other before the Ballou family moved west to Muskingum County, Ohio. After three years Abram would follow, only to find out that Hitty had already married a cousin. Within three months of reuniting, Eliza and Abram were married on February 3, 1820 in Perry Township, OH. They traveled north into Cuyahoga County where Abram farmed. When work began on the Ohio and Erie Canal, Abram obtained a contract to build a section of this great waterway. Eliza prepared meals for all the construction workers and sang songs in the evenings to keep their spirits high. She was known to have a lovely voice and knew many tunes. The Garfields had four children in quick succession: Meh i tabel in 1821, Thomas in 1822; Mary in 1824; and James Ballou in 1826. Their youngest, James Ballou, died at the age of two. Eliza was alone with her children one January night in 1829 when young Jimmy was taken with a fever and died in her arms. Eliza became quite despondent after losing her youngest child, but she found comfort in her new religion, the Disciples of Christ. When she realized that she was to have another child, she hoped and prayed for a son to take the place of the one she had lost. The new baby was given the name of the son that died, plus his father’s name. James Abram Garfield was born on November 19, 1831, and Eliza knew he was destined to be great and good. The family’s happiness in their new home in Orange Township would be brief. When a forest fire raged nearby, Abram fought bravely to keep the fire away from his home and family. Afterward, he was taken ill with a chill. Before dying, he is reported to have said, “Eliza, I have planted four saplings in these woods. I leave them in your care.” Eliza was determined to keep her family together. She sold a portion of her land to pay off debts. Eliza may have had help from her brother-in-law, Amos Boynton. It is uncertain whether Eliza was able to use her talents as a seamstress to earn money for the fatherless family (some sources say she did so). Devoted to her children, she guided them and shaped their lives with affection. Years later, her children would remember the songs she sang and the stories she told.

It was published under her pen name \\\"Currer Bell\\\" on 19 October 1847 by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. of London. The first American edition was published the following year by Harper &amp; Brothers of New York. [ 2 ] Jane Eyre is a bildungsroman that follows the experiences of its eponymous heroine , including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr Rochester , the brooding master of Thornfield Hall . [ 3 ] \\n The novel revolutionised prose fiction , being the first to focus on the moral and spiritual development of its protagonist through an intimate first-person narrative , where actions and events are coloured by a psychological intensity. Charlotte Brontë has been called the \\\"first historian of the private consciousness\\\" and the literary ancestor of writers such as Marcel Proust and James Joyce . [ 4 ] \\n The book contains elements of social criticism with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core, and it is considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane's individualistic character and how the novel approaches the topics of class , sexuality , religion and feminism . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Jane Eyre , along with Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice , is one of the most famous romance novels . [ 7 ] It is considered one of the greatest novels in the English language, [ 8 ] and in 2003 was ranked as the tenth best-loved book in Britain by the BBC in The Big Read poll.\\n \\n Jane Eyre is divided into 38 chapters. It was originally published in three volumes in the 19th century, consisting of chapters 1 to 15, 16 to 27, and 28 to 38.\\n The second edition was dedicated to William Makepeace Thackeray .\\n The novel is a first-person narrative from the perspective of the title character. Its setting is somewhere in the north of England, late in the reign of George III (1760–1820). [ a ] It has five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her mysterious employer, Edward Fairfax Rochester; her time in the Moor House, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St John Rivers, proposes to her; and ultimately her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester.

There are over 6,400 high-rise buildings in NYC. Though other boroughs have high-rise buildings (like the Hub in Downtown Brooklyn or YIMBY in Queens), Manhattan has constructed some of the world’s tallest buildings since 1890.

This means that if Punxsutawney Phil had been making predictions during that time, he would have been in the same state as the U.S. capital.\n\n### Step 4: How many years earlier would Punxsutawney Phil need to exist?\nPunxsutawney Phil's first recorded Groundhog Day prediction was in 1887. To have made a prediction while the U.S. capital was in Pennsylvania, he would need to have existed at least **87 years earlier** (1887 - 1800 = 87).\n\n### Final Answer:\nPunxsutawney Phil would need to have been canonically alive **87 years earlier** to have made a Groundhog Day prediction in the same state as the U.S. capital.", "is_correct": true, "ground_truth": "87"}]}

An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC , Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were considered.

These 16 teams advanced to the knockout stage , where three rounds of play decided which teams would participate in the final .\\n In the final, Spain , the European champions , beat third-time losing finalists the Netherlands 1–0 after extra time to win their first world title. Spain became the eighth nation to win the tournament and the first European nation to win a World Cup hosted outside its home continent: all previous World Cups held outside Europe had been won by South American nations. They are also the first national team since 1978 to win a World Cup after losing a game in the group stage. As a result of their win, Spain represented the World in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup .

Helgesen and Kristoffer Austrheim formed a death metal band called \\\"The Headless Children\\\". They were both only thirteen years of age. After a couple of weeks, The Headless Children had finished their first song; \\\"Close To Death.\\\" A true death/speed metal song, influenced by bands like Slayer and Kreator . \\nThe following year they were joined by vocalist Erik Borgen and guitarist Kenneth Bergsagel. They changed their name to \\\"Carnal Tomb,\\\" and got more and more influenced by black metal. Carnal Tomb only managed to make one song, called \\\"Black Funeral,\\\" a song which hopefully will appear on a release by Dismal Euphony, sometime in the future. \\nSoon Erik Borgen left, and Ole took over the vocals. Linn Achre Tveit (Keltziva) joined as a second vocalist (she soon got more important). Elin Overskott joined on keyboards. As the music got more melodic and melancholic they decided to change their name again. \\\"Dismal Euphony\\\" was a correct description of the new music. \\nIn 1995 the band released a demo called \\\"Spellbound.\\\" The demo awoke huge interest all over Europe. They soon got offers from record labels like Nocturnal Art Productions, Malicious Records and Napalm Records. Napalm records re-released the demo on a MCD, which sold thousands all over the world. \\n\\\"Soria Moria Slott\\\" was their first full-length album. It was quite a success for Napalm Records and the band. So was the next album; Autumn Leaves. The two albums made Metal Blade Records and Nuclear Blast Records interested in the band, with Nuclear Blast eventually signing the band. \\nOn September 6th, 2004, the body of former keyboardist Elin Overskott was found in Stavanger, Norway. She died of a heroin overdose 24 years old after having been clean for more than two years.\",\n      \"image\": \"https://metalstorm.net/images/fb_icon.jpg\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://metalstorm.net/images/apple-touch-icon.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismal_Euphony\",\n      \"title\": \"Dismal Euphony - Wikipedia\",\n      \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismal_Euphony\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2023-12-19T17:32:35.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\",\n      \"text\": \"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \\n \\n Dismal Euphony Origin Stavanger , Norway Genres Symphonic black metal Gothic metal Years active 1994–2001 Labels Nuclear Blast , Napalm Past members See below \\n Dismal Euphony was a metal band from Norway that mixed styles including gothic metal , melodic metal, black metal and classical music .\\n \\n The history of Dismal Euphony began in 1992 in Stavanger, Norway by bassist Ole K.

Travis County voters backed Watson’s vision in 2012 and approved a local property tax increase to invest in the medical school, which welcomed its first class of students in 2016. Building upon the success of Dell Medical School, the University of Texas System recently announced a $2.5 billion investment to create two new world-class medical facilities at UT Austin, including a partnership with the MD Anderson Cancer Center. Mayor Watson has also worked in the area of brain health both in the legislature and local government. \\n As a result of his numerous health care efforts, Watson has been honored by the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute and NAMI Austin.

It is thought to date to the 11th century, within a few years of the battle. Now widely accepted to have been made in England, perhaps as a gift for William, it tells the story from the point of view of the conquering Normans and for centuries has been preserved in Normandy.\\n According to Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry, in her 2005 book La Tapisserie de Bayeux :\\n \\n The Bayeux tapestry is one of the supreme achievements of the Norman Romanesque .... Its survival almost intact over nine centuries is little short of miraculous ... Its exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit combine to make it endlessly fascinating. [ 2 ] \\n The cloth consists of 58 scenes, [ note 1 ] many with Latin tituli , embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns. It is likely that it was commissioned by Bishop Odo of Bayeux , William's maternal half-brother, and made for him in England in the 1070s. In 1729, the hanging was rediscovered by scholars at a time when it was being displayed annually in Bayeux Cathedral . The tapestry is now exhibited at the Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux in Bayeux , Normandy , France ( 49°16′28″N 0°42′01″W / 49.2744°N 0.7003°W ). \\n The designs on the Bayeux Tapestry are embroidered rather than in a tapestry weave , so it does not meet narrower definitions of a tapestry. [ 5 ] Nevertheless, it has always been referred to as a tapestry until recent years when the name \\\"Bayeux Embroidery\\\" has gained ground among certain art historians. It can be seen as a rare example of secular Romanesque art . Tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in Medieval Western Europe, though at 0.5 by 68.38 m (1 ft 8 in by 224 ft 4 in), the Bayeux Tapestry is exceptionally large. The background is not embroidered, providing a large, clear field of cloth which allows the figures and decorative elements to stand out very clearly.\\n \\n Bishop Odo of Bayeux \\n The earliest known written reference to the tapestry is a 1476 inventory of Bayeux Cathedral , [ 6 ] but its origins have been the subject of much speculation and controversy.\\n French legend maintained the tapestry was commissioned and created by Queen Matilda , William the Conqueror 's wife, and her ladies-in-waiting . Indeed, in France, it is occasionally known as La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde (\\\"The Tapestry of Queen Matilda\\\"). However, scholarly analysis in the 20th century concluded it was probably commissioned by William's half-brother, Bishop Odo of Bayeux , [ 7 ]\",\n      \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Odo_bayeux_tapestry.png/640px-Odo_bayeux_tapestry.png\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"costDollars\": {\n    \"total\": 0.006,\n    \"search\": {\n      \"neural\": 0.005\n    },\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"text\": 0.001\n    }\n  }\n}"}, {"step": 3, "response": "The Pope born Pietro Barbo, also known as Pope Paul II, ended a long-running war two years after his papacy began in 1464.

She spent the 1920s and 1930s painting in Britain, France and Italy. [ 2 ] \\n \\n Cumbrae Stewart was born on 23 December 1883 in Brighton, Victoria , Australia. [ 3 ] She was born Janet Agnes Stewart , the youngest of ten children born to Francis Edward Stewart (1833–1904) and Agnes Park (1843–1927). Janet's eldest brother, Francis William Sutton Stewart, became convinced of a family connection to the Stuarts of Bute and despite never proving the link, adopted \\\"Cumbrae\\\" to his name, and his siblings followed suit. [ 4 ] This addition to the name would later serve a greater purpose for Janet, who quickly abandoned the hyphen and identified herself professionally as simply Cumbrae Stewart, and so avoided, to a certain extent, the limitations and scrutiny attached to her sex.\\n The Stewarts lived a very traditional upper middle class existence, with the boys studying at private school and the three girls receiving their early education at home under the supervision of a governess. [ 5 ] As well as her lessons, Cumbrae Stewart also received instruction in several suitable 'past-times' including dancing, piano and drawing; this latter she was instructed by Zena Beatrice Selwyn , who would later marry Cumbrae Stewart's brother Francis in 1906. During her late teens, Cumbrae Stewart joined landscape painter, John Mather , and his students, on outdoor sketching exhibitions. [ 6 ] \\n From 1903 though 1908 Cumbrae Stewart studied at the Melbourne National Gallery School , where she was taught by Lindsay Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin . [ 7 ] During this time she won a slew of awards: first prize for Drawing from Antique in 1904, Still Life Painting in 1905, Second place for Half Nude Painting and Life Drawing in 1906, and third prize for Drawing a Head from Life in 1903 and third place in the coveted Travelling Scholarship prize in 1908 for The Old Gown in 1908 (first and second places were both awarded to Constance Jenkins ).\\n Following her art education, Cumbrae Stewart rented premises in Melbourne and commenced exhibiting. She participated in the first Exhibition of Women's Work held in Melbourne in 1907, and exhibited with the Victorian Artists Society from 1908 to 1920. She also exhibited with the Queensland Art Society , the Australian Artists Association and the South Australian Society of Arts , as well as the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors . She held her first solo exhibition at the Coles Book Arcade gallery in Collins Street in 1911, from which Bernard Hall purchased a pastel of a head, and Rupert Bunny purchased a landscape.

It is known that among these founders were Daisy Stone, Tina Gowdie, Annie Gates, Kate Allan, Ella Thorn, Henrietta Maria Gulliver and a Miss Stock (otherwise unidentified, who died in 1906). [ 1 ] In 1905 they added the indigenous word \\\"Woomballano\\\" (meaning either 'everlasting beauty' or 'search for beauty') to identify their Art Club, changing its title to The Women's Art Club in 1913 then to the Melbourne Society of Women Painters in 1930. The present designation was adopted in 1954. [ 1 ] \\n Many of its early members were plein air painters and identified with the Heidelberg School , which was regarded widely as a male group but which involved many women. The interest in the decorative arts at the opening of the twentieth century attracted other members who were significant craftspeople. By the 1920s, the Society was assimilating the generation of professional women artists emerging from the Melbourne National Gallery School, with significant women artists, representatives of both the Meldrum tonal school and modernism , being invited to join. The Society was less overtly feminist than its Sydney counterpart The Society of Women Painters (later named Women’s Industrial Arts Society ) which was founded in 1910 in reaction to the discrimination of male-dominated juries of art institutions and societies. [ 2 ] During the Second World War the MSWPS opened volunteer headquarters at Grosvenor Chambers (9 Collins Street , Melbourne) where they made and sold handcrafts and art to raise money for the war effort.

The family migrated to Victoria next year. Dora was educated at Somerset School and Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne. Known as 'Wiltz' to her colleagues, she studied at the National Gallery schools in 1901-06 under Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin . She was impressed by the Anders Zorn etchings in the gallery collection and, together with Jessie Traill and Janie Wilkinson Whyte, took lessons from John Mather . Their etchings were reproduced in the Lone Hand (1907) and constituted some of the earliest efforts in the medium by women. In 1907 she contributed to the Australian Exhibition of Women's Work in Melbourne. Like her colleague Janet Cumbrae Stewart with whom she was compared, Wilson excelled in pastels. From 1910 her studio, 'a picturesque and ancient rookery' at Temple Court, Collins Street West, was the meeting place of the 'Waddy', a group of ex-students who in 1913-14 exhibited as 'The Twelve Melbourne Painters'. \\n \\nWilson's reputation grew steadily. Her etchings, pastels and oils of still life, nudes and portraits (especially of children) were noted for their fine draughtsmanship. Although they were sometimes criticized for using tired themes or for being overly 'sweet' and 'coy', they sold well. In 1923 she contributed to the Exhibition of Australian Art at Burlington House, London. Woman's World reproduced on its cover her painting, 'Reve d'Or', which had been accepted at the Salon de la Société des Artistes Français, Paris, and the magazine described Dora's sense of humour, 'quaint personality' and 'shy, self-deprecating manner'. \\n \\nIn the mid-1920s she began to concentrate on the street scenes for which she is best remembered. She invested them with particular atmospheric effects, such as dappled light filtered through trees. Opening her exhibition 'The Lure of Melbourne' at the Fine Art Society Gallery in May 1931, Sir William Brunton commented on the novel sight of 'a woman in a motor car with an easel in front of her … painting the life of the busy city'. \\n \\nFollowing a commission from Sir Baldwin Spencer to paint European landmarks, in 1927 Wilson had gone abroad for two and a half years; she toured the Continent and Britain with photographer Peg Clarke, sometimes travelling on foot and often sleeping in barns. In 1928 Wilson exhibited at the Beaux Arts Gallery, London, and next year at Australia House. Her style, dependent on a bright palette and on simple, broad impasto brushwork, was praised by Arthur Streeton in 1931 for its freshness and freedom from 'the depressing appearance of black paint'. Her art, while not embracing modernism, did show the influence of its basic tenets, as the critic Basil Burdett and the artist Blamire Young appreciated. In the 1930s Dora painted a series of Australian historical pictures, concentrating on the Victorian era, \",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://adb.anu.edu.au/images/site/adb/favicon.ico\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1104024301764625&id=100064711957701&set=a.473930148107380\",\n      \"title\": \"Dora Lynnell Wilson (Australian painter and etcher) 1883 - Facebook\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1104024301764625&id=100064711957701&set=a.473930148107380\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"text\": \"You’re Temporarily Blocked It looks like you were misusing this feature by going too fast.

[ 1 ] Mining potential is noted in industrial and metallic minerals, energy, precious and semi-precious stones, as well as ornamental stone. [ 2 ] The mining sector was neglected by the government for decades prior to the mid-2000s. [ 3 ] In 2013, the mining industry, a main source of foreign investment, was struggling due to \\\"low metals prices and distrustful companies\\\", attributed to a 2009 coup . [ 4 ] \\n \\n Mining was a part of Madagascar's cultural lore dating back to the 15th century before it became a reality at the beginning of the 19th century. Speculations of valuable metal and mineral deposits in Madagascar came with the arrival of the Imerina people, also known as the Antimerina, Merina, or Hova people, [ 5 ] in the 15th century when they established their small kingdom in central Madagascar. [ 6 ] \\n These speculations of valuable metal and mineral deposits are rooted in a traditional Malagasy story titled Tantaran'ny Andriana (which translates as The History of the Nobles ). [ 7 ] Tantaran'ny Andriana is a story told in the oral tradition that shares the history of the kings of Imerina. [ 7 ] In addition to sharing the history of the Imerina kings, Tantaran'ny Andriana suggests that there are prevalent silver deposits across the island. [ 7 ] \\n As people around the world, especially Europeans, began to hear Tantaran'ny Andriana and therefore, the associated speculations of valuable mineral and metal deposits, explorers began to search for \\\"Malagasy Eldorado,\\\" which roughly translates to \\\"Madagascar, the country of fabulous riches.\\\" The main group of explorers searching for \\\"Malagasy Eldorado\\\" and the precious deposits were Europeans. [ 7 ] The first known explorer to search for Madagascar's deposits was Tristão da Cunha , a Portuguese explorer, yet he was followed by many other European explorers. [ 7 ] Upon arrival, explorers did not find the extent of valuable deposits that they were expecting – they found that the gold, silver, and other metals and minerals were typically imported to Madagascar and then turned into jewelry.\\n Although European explorers did not find the deposits they were expecting, it is believed that the Malagasy people during this period did have knowledge of and worked alluvial deposits, which is \\\"the mining of stream bed deposits ,\\\" [ 8 ] for \\\" volamena \\\" (gold).

[ 2 ] He was educated at Bristol Grammar School , where he became interested in chemistry , then after two years with a private tutor entered St John's College, Cambridge , graduating BA in 1784 and MA in 1787.

He married Charlotte Anne Gwatkin in 1790 and they had one daughter, Charlotte-Anne Gregor. [ 5 ] \\n \\n Discovery of titanium [ edit ] \\n After a brief interval at Bratton Clovelly , in 1793 William and his family moved permanently to the rectory of Creed in Cornwall . Here he continued his remarkably accurate chemical analysis of minerals , most of which came from Cornwall, such as the zeolites found in gabbro on The Lizard . He also analysed wavellite , tourmaline , and the uranium minerals torbernite and autunite , the arsenate scorodite , the lead mineral mimetite and the nickel mineral niccolite , [ 5 ] and others. But he is best known for one of his earliest discoveries: in 1791, while analysing the minerals in a black sand he had discovered in the Manaccan valley, he isolated the calx of an unknown metal which he named manaccanite . [ 1 ] Later in 1791, Martin Heinrich Klaproth discovered what is now known as the transition metal , titanium in the mineral rutile . Believing this to be a new discovery, Klaproth named it titanium after the Titans of Greek Mythology , but eventually it was clarified that Gregor made the discovery first. Gregor was credited with the discovery, but the element kept the name chosen by Klaproth. Gregor later found titanium in corundum from Tibet , and in a tourmaline from a local tin mine.\\n \\n Gregor was made an honorary member of the Geological Society of London on its inception in 1807, and was a founding member of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall in 1814. [ 1 ] His friends and correspondents included John Hawkins , Philip Rashleigh and John Ayrton Paris . Never letting his scientific work interfere with his pastoral duties, he was also a distinguished landscape painter, etcher and musician. He died of tuberculosis on 11 June 1817 and was buried at nearby Cornelly church. [ 6 ] \\n \\n \\n ^ a b c d Boase, G.

However, shortly before leaving, they are informed that they are limited to 44 pounds of luggage per person. The Southern Baptist Mission League suggests they solve this problem by leaving for the airport wearing many layers of clothing, hiding household items among the layers of clothes to lighten their luggage.\\n The Price daughters – Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May – and their mother, Orleanna, and father, Nathan, attend their first church service in the village of Kilanga, and they realize how different their culture is from that of the Congo. For example, 14-year-old Leah helps her father plant a \\\"demonstration garden\\\"; it immediately receives criticism from Mama Tataba, whom the family has engaged as a live-in maid, and the garden does poorly due to the inappropriate climate. Nathan tries to hold an impromptu Easter celebration in hopes of baptizing numerous people, but he is unable to carry this out, as the river along the village, where he plans to hold the baptism, is infested with crocodiles.\\n Leah and her twin Adah begin to spy on Eeben Axelroot, the pilot who conveyed the family to Kilanga, and Nathan tries to convince Congolese men, one by one, to convert to Christianity.

Following the death of her father, a Congregationalist minister and president of Bowdoin College, Jane attended boarding school in Keene, New Hampshire. She later met a Bowdoin graduate, a young lawyer with political ambitions, Franklin Pierce. \\n Although he was immediately devoted to Jane, they did not marry until she was 28 on November 19, 1834 — surprising in that day of early marriages. Her family opposed the match; moreover, she always did her best to discourage his interest in politics. The death of a three-day-old son, the arrival of a new baby, and Jane’s dislike of Washington counted heavily in his decision to retire at the apparent height of his career, as United States Senator, in 1842. Little Frank Robert, the second son, died the next year of typhus. \\n Service in the Mexican-American War brought Pierce the rank of brigadier and local fame as a hero. He returned home safely, and for four years the Pierces lived quietly at Concord, New Hampshire, in the happiest period of their lives. With attentive pleasure Jane watched her son Benjamin \\\"Bennie\\\" growing up. \\n Then, in 1852, the Democratic Party made Pierce their candidate for president. His wife fainted at the news. When he took her to Newport for a respite, Bennie wrote to her: “I hope he won’t be elected for I should not like to be at Washington and I know you would not either.” But the president-elect convinced Jane that his office would be an asset for Bennie’s success in life. \\n On a journey by train, on January 6, 1853, their car was derailed and Bennie killed before their eyes. The whole nation shared the parents’ grief. The inauguration on March 4 took place without an inaugural ball and without the presence of Mrs. Pierce. She joined her husband later that month, but any pleasure the White House might have brought her was gone. From this loss she never recovered fully. \\n Always devout, Jane Pierce turned for solace to prayer. She had to force herself to meet the social obligations inherent in the role of first lady. Fortunately, she had the companionship and help of a girlhood friend, now her aunt by marriage, Abigail Kent Means. Mrs. Robert E. Lee wrote in a private letter: “I have known many of the ladies of the White House, none more truly excellent than the afflicted wife of President Pierce. Her health was a bar to any great effort on her part to meet the expectations of the public in her high position but she was a reﬁned, extremely religious and well educated lady.” \\n With retirement, the Pierces made a prolonged trip abroad in search of health—she carried Bennie’s Bible throughout the journey. The quest was unsuccessful, so the couple came home to New Hampshire to be near family and friends until Jane’s death on December 2, 1863. \\n She was buried near Bennie’s grave. \\n \\n \\n You Might Also Like \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Collection \\n The Carter White House 1977 - 1981 \\n \\n On\",\n      \"image\": \"https://d1y822qhq55g6.cloudfront.net/default/_superImage/Jane-Means-Appleton-Pierce.jpg\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/favicon.ico\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Pierce\",\n      \"title\": \"Jane Pierce - Wikipedia\",\n      \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Pierce\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-03-29T23:25:55.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\",\n      \"text\": \"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \\n \\n Jane Pierce Pierce in 1857 First Lady of the United States In role March 4, 1853 – March 4, 1857 President Franklin Pierce Preceded by Abigail Fillmore Succeeded by Harriet Lane (acting) Personal details Born Jane Means Appleton March 12, 1806 Hampton, New Hampshire , U.S. Died December 2, 1863 (aged 57) Andover, Massachusetts , U.S. Resting place Old North Cemetery Spouse \\n Franklin Pierce ​ ( m. ) ​ Children 3 Parent(s) Jesse Appleton Elizabeth Means Signature \\n Jane Means Pierce ( née Appleton ; March 12, 1806 – December 2, 1863) was the first lady of the United States from 1853 to 1857, being married to Franklin Pierce , the 14th president of the United States .\\n Born in Hampton, New Hampshire , she married Pierce, then a congressman, in 1834 despite her family's misgivings.

Her parents were James Ballou and Mehitable Ingalls. Her father was a talented mathematician and clairvoyant, known as “James the Astrologer.” He ran a public house before his sudden death after a fall in his barn in April, 1808. Her mother Mehitable was described as a plucky, red-haired woman and a skillful weaver. Eliza was described as unusually attractive, petite, sprightly, industrious, intelligent, and a tireless spirit of activity. Eliza became acquainted with her future husband, Abram Garfield, when asking him for directions. She denied any interest in the “green boy,” but was soon smitten with the strong, handsome man Abram had become. He and her sister Hitty were promised to each other before the Ballou family moved west to Muskingum County, Ohio. After three years Abram would follow, only to find out that Hitty had already married a cousin. Within three months of reuniting, Eliza and Abram were married on February 3, 1820 in Perry Township, OH. They traveled north into Cuyahoga County where Abram farmed. When work began on the Ohio and Erie Canal, Abram obtained a contract to build a section of this great waterway. Eliza prepared meals for all the construction workers and sang songs in the evenings to keep their spirits high. She was known to have a lovely voice and knew many tunes. The Garfields had four children in quick succession: Meh i tabel in 1821, Thomas in 1822; Mary in 1824; and James Ballou in 1826. Their youngest, James Ballou, died at the age of two. Eliza was alone with her children one January night in 1829 when young Jimmy was taken with a fever and died in her arms. Eliza became quite despondent after losing her youngest child, but she found comfort in her new religion, the Disciples of Christ. When she realized that she was to have another child, she hoped and prayed for a son to take the place of the one she had lost. The new baby was given the name of the son that died, plus his father’s name. James Abram Garfield was born on November 19, 1831, and Eliza knew he was destined to be great and good. The family’s happiness in their new home in Orange Township would be brief. When a forest fire raged nearby, Abram fought bravely to keep the fire away from his home and family. Afterward, he was taken ill with a chill. Before dying, he is reported to have said, “Eliza, I have planted four saplings in these woods. I leave them in your care.” Eliza was determined to keep her family together. She sold a portion of her land to pay off debts. Eliza may have had help from her brother-in-law, Amos Boynton. It is uncertain whether Eliza was able to use her talents as a seamstress to earn money for the fatherless family (some sources say she did so). Devoted to her children, she guided them and shaped their lives with affection. Years later, her children would remember the songs she sang and the stories she told.

Central Park Tower is the second-tallest building in New York City (behind One World Trade Center ), the United States , and the Western Hemisphere; the 15th tallest building in the world ; the tallest primarily residential building in the world ; and the tallest building outside Asia by roof height.\\n Central Park Tower was developed by Extell Development Company and Shanghai Municipal Investment Group . The basement and first five above-ground stories contain a large Nordstrom store, which opened in 2019. The eastern portion of the tower contains a cantilever above the Art Students League of New York 's building at 215 West 57th Street , intended to maximize views of nearby Central Park . The residential portion of the tower contains 179 condominiums, spanning on average 5,000 sq ft (460 m 2 ), with interiors designed by Rottet Studio . There are also amenities spaces on floors 14 through 16 as well as a private club on floor 100.\\n The site of Central Park Tower was assembled during the first decade of the 21st century; during the acquisition process, the tower was delayed after two buildings at 225 West 57th Street and 1780 Broadway were considered for New York City landmark status. Despite uncertainty about the final design and complications relating to financing, excavations at the site started in May 2014 and above-ground construction started in early 2015.

There are over 6,400 high-rise buildings in NYC. Though other boroughs have high-rise buildings (like the Hub in Downtown Brooklyn or YIMBY in Queens), Manhattan has constructed some of the world’s tallest buildings since 1890. The majority are located in Midtown and Lower Manhattan due to the area’s solid surface bedrock and its ability to provide structural integrity for these buildings.

It was Washington who saw the area’s potential economic and accessibility benefits due to the proximity of navigable rivers. George Washington, who had been in office just over a year when the capital site was determined, asked a French architect and city planner named Pierre L Enfant to design the capital. In 1793, the first cornerstones of the president’s mansion, which was eventually renamed the “ White House ,” were laid. George Washington, however, never lived in the mansion as it was not inhabitable until 1800. Instead, President John Adams and his wife Abigail were the White House’s first residents.

You can read the actual line at the National Archives. From its beginning, it has been embroiled in political maneuvering, sectional conflicts and issues of race, national identity, compromise and, of course, power. \\n Like many decisions in American history, the location of the new city was to be a compromise: Alexander Hamilton and northern states wanted the new federal government to assume Revolutionary War debts, and Thomas Jefferson and southern states who wanted the capital placed in a location friendly to slave-holding agricultural interests. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n President George Washington chose the exact site along the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, and the city was officially founded in 1790 after both Maryland and Virginia ceded land to this new “district,” to be distinct and distinguished from the rest of the states. To design the city, he appointed Pierre Charles L’Enfant, who presented a vision for a bold, modern city featuring grand boulevards (now the streets named for states) and ceremonial spaces reminiscent of another great world capital, L’Enfant’s native Paris. He planned a grid system, at which the center would be the Capitol building. \\n Even before coming of age, DC was nearly completely destroyed. During the War of 1812 against Great Britain, enemy forces invaded the city and burned much of it to the ground, including the newly completed White House, the Capitol and the Library of Congress (including all of its books). Thomas Jefferson later replenished the library’s collection by selling off his entire library for $23,950 in 1815. \\n After the devastation, the city remained small, especially in terms of permanent residents. Soon it would become smaller in physical size as well. In 1847, the portion of the city that had originally belonged to Virginia was retroceded, after the voters of Alexandria elected to leave DC, feeling that they had been left out of development on the other side of the river. You can still see some surviving, original markers for the District today. \\n The city only increased in size as a result of the Civil War. Slaves owned in Washington were emancipated on April 16, 1862, nine months before the Emancipation Proclamation, and it therefore became a hub for freed slaves. After, it remained a home to a significant and vibrant African American population, which included abolitionist Frederick Douglass. A substantial army was set up just to protect the capital during the war, and the federal government grew around this administration. \\n \\"}, {"step": 2, "response": "Washington, D.C. became the capital of the United States on July 16, 1790.

During the ceremony, which begins well before the winter sunrise, Phil emerges from his temporary home on Gobbler's Knob , located in a rural area about 2 miles (3 km) southeast of the town. According to the tradition, if Phil sees his shadow and returns to his hole, he has predicted six more weeks of winter -like weather. [ 1 ] If Phil does not see his shadow, he has predicted an \\\"early spring .\\\" [ 2 ] Punxsutawney's event is the most famous of many Groundhog Day festivals held in the United States and Canada. The event formally began in 1887, although its roots go back even further. [ 3 ] \\n The event is based upon a communal light-hearted suspension of disbelief which extends to the assertion that the same groundhog has been making predictions since the 19th century.\\n The event is organized by the \\\"Inner Circle\\\" – recognizable by their top hats and tuxedos – who ostensibly communicate with Phil to receive his prediction.\\nThe vice president of the Inner Circle prepares two scrolls in advance of the actual ceremony, one proclaiming six more weeks of winter and one proclaiming an early spring. At daybreak on February 2, Punxsutawney Phil awakens from his burrow on Gobbler's Knob, is helped to the top of the stump by his handlers, and purportedly explains to the president of the Inner Circle, in a language known as \\\"Groundhogese\\\", [ 3 ] whether he has seen his shadow. The president of the Inner Circle, the only person able to understand Groundhogese through his possession of an ancient acacia wood cane, then interprets Phil's message, and directs the vice president to read the proper scroll to the crowd gathered on Gobbler's Knob and the masses of \\\"phaithphil phollowers\\\" tuned in to live broadcasts around the world. [ 4 ] \\n Outside of Groundhog Day, Phil resides with a mate, Phyllis, at the Punxsutawney Memorial Library in a climate-controlled environment. In March 2024, the Inner Circle announced that Phil had sired two babies, the first time in the history of the event that such a siring had happened; the birth surprised the Inner Circle, which had assumed that groundhogs do not breed in captivity. As a result of the births, the family will move permanently to Gobbler's Knob. The Inner Circle disowned the babies from ever inheriting their father's position. [ 5 ] \\n \\n Punxsutawney Phil canon [ edit ] \\n The practices and lore of Punxsutawney Phil's predictions are predicated on a light-hearted suspension of disbelief by those involved.

Helgesen and Kristoffer Austrheim formed a death metal band called \\\"The Headless Children\\\". They were both only thirteen years of age. After a couple of weeks, The Headless Children had finished their first song; \\\"Close To Death.\\\" A true death/speed metal song, influenced by bands like Slayer and Kreator . \\nThe following year they were joined by vocalist Erik Borgen and guitarist Kenneth Bergsagel. They changed their name to \\\"Carnal Tomb,\\\" and got more and more influenced by black metal. Carnal Tomb only managed to make one song, called \\\"Black Funeral,\\\" a song which hopefully will appear on a release by Dismal Euphony, sometime in the future. \\nSoon Erik Borgen left, and Ole took over the vocals. Linn Achre Tveit (Keltziva) joined as a second vocalist (she soon got more important). Elin Overskott joined on keyboards. As the music got more melodic and melancholic they decided to change their name again. \\\"Dismal Euphony\\\" was a correct description of the new music. \\nIn 1995 the band released a demo called \\\"Spellbound.\\\" The demo awoke huge interest all over Europe. They soon got offers from record labels like Nocturnal Art Productions, Malicious Records and Napalm Records. Napalm records re-released the demo on a MCD, which sold thousands all over the world. \\n\\\"Soria Moria Slott\\\" was their first full-length album. It was quite a success for Napalm Records and the band. So was the next album; Autumn Leaves. The two albums made Metal Blade Records and Nuclear Blast Records interested in the band, with Nuclear Blast eventually signing the band. \\nOn September 6th, 2004, the body of former keyboardist Elin Overskott was found in Stavanger, Norway. She died of a heroin overdose 24 years old after having been clean for more than two years.\",\n      \"image\": \"https://metalstorm.net/images/fb_icon.jpg\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://metalstorm.net/images/apple-touch-icon.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismal_Euphony\",\n      \"title\": \"Dismal Euphony - Wikipedia\",\n      \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismal_Euphony\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2023-12-19T17:32:35.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\",\n      \"text\": \"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \\n \\n Dismal Euphony Origin Stavanger , Norway Genres Symphonic black metal Gothic metal Years active 1994–2001 Labels Nuclear Blast , Napalm Past members See below \\n Dismal Euphony was a metal band from Norway that mixed styles including gothic metal , melodic metal, black metal and classical music .\\n \\n The history of Dismal Euphony began in 1992 in Stavanger, Norway by bassist Ole K.

Deriving its name from the city in Monaco , the Monte Carlo was marketed as the first personal luxury car of the Chevrolet brand. Introduced for the 1970 model year, the model line was produced across six generations through the 2007 model year, with a hiatus from 1989 until 1994. The Monte Carlo was a variant of the Pontiac Grand Prix throughout its production.\\n From 1970 until 1972, the Monte Carlo rode on the unique \\\"A-Special\\\" platform with the Grand Prix, shifting to the standard A-body intermediate chassis from the 1973 through 1977 model years. For 1978, the Monte Carlo line underwent downsizing, but was still considered a midsized coupe. The rear-wheel drive A-body platform of this generation of Monte Carlo was redesignated as the G-body when GM's front-wheel drive A-body cars were introduced for the 1982 model year. After an abbreviated 1988 model year, the Monte Carlo was replaced by the two-door Chevrolet Lumina .\\n For the 1995 model year, the Monte Carlo was revived, replacing the two-door Lumina. It shared the front-wheel drive W-platform with the two-door Grand Prix, and was the largest coupe in the Chevrolet lineup. After the 2002 model year, the Grand Prix coupe was discontinued, the Monte Carlo became the largest two-door model produced by an American auto manufacturer.\\n In response to declining sales of the model line, Chevrolet discontinued the Monte Carlo after the 2008 model year. [ 2 ] During much of its production, the Monte Carlo represented the Chevrolet brand in stock car racing . During the 1980s, the Monte Carlo SS was introduced, featuring aerodynamically-enhanced styling; as part of its revival, the Monte Carlo again represented Chevrolet in stock car racing from 1995 through its discontinuation.\\n \\n For the 1968 model year, GM instituted a split- wheelbase policy for its A-platform intermediate-sized cars. Two-door models would have a 112 in (2,845 mm) wheelbase, 116 in (2,946 mm) for sedans , and 121 in (3,073 mm) for station wagons . In 1969, GM introduced the Pontiac Grand Prix , a two-door that used the A-platform layout that was stretched ahead of the firewall to make it 210.2-inch (5,339 mm) long. This gave the design an unusually long hood design, helping the new Grand Prix to outsell its larger B-body predecessor despite higher prices. The new layout was first known as the A-body Special, but would evolve into its own class known as the G-platform . [ 3 ] \\n The Monte Carlo began as Chevrolet's version of the Pontiac Grand Prix, as conceived by Elliot M.

The lunar module landed safely some 6 km from the originally intended landing site, approximately 400 meters west of West crater and 20km south-southwest of the crater Sabine D in the southwestern part of Mare Tranquilitatis.

However, the search results mention the Battle of Pavia, which took place in 1525. Though this date does not align perfectly with the \"400 years earlier\" note, it seems to be the conflict that fits the description best due to its fame and representation in tapestry art.\n\nThe famous conflict immortalized in tapestry that took place around 400 years before the time Pope Paul II ended the war is the Battle of Pavia. The Battle of Pavia is renowned and was documented in a series of tapestries, much like the famous Bayeux Tapestry depicting the Norman conquest of England.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: The Battle of Pavia.", "is_correct": false, "ground_truth": "The Battle of Hastings.", "all_completion_tokens": 277, "all_prompt_tokens": 5421, "time_cost": 28.12856388092041}]}

During her late teens, Cumbrae Stewart joined landscape painter, John Mather , and his students, on outdoor sketching exhibitions.

She participated in the first Exhibition of Women's Work held in Melbourne in 1907, and exhibited with the Victorian Artists Society from 1908 to 1920. She also exhibited with the Queensland Art Society , the Australian Artists Association and the South Australian Society of Arts , as well as the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors .

The father of the family creates his own \\\"misprint\\\" of the Bible. He concludes his sermons with the Kikongo expression \\\"Tata Jesus is bängala\\\" with the intent of saying \\\"Jesus is most precious\\\". In his hurried mispronunciation, he actually says \\\"Jesus is poisonwood \\\".\\n \\n Orleanna Price, the mother of the family, narrates the introductory chapter in five of the novel's seven sections. The narrative then alternates among the four daughters, with a slight preference for the voice of the most conflicted one, Leah. [ original research? ] The four girls increasingly mature and develop differently as each adapts to African village life and the political turmoil that overtakes the Belgian Congo in the 1960s.\\n The Price family packs up their belongings for their flight to the Congo, where they are going to spend a year as the family of a missionary. However, shortly before leaving, they are informed that they are limited to 44 pounds of luggage per person. The Southern Baptist Mission League suggests they solve this problem by leaving for the airport wearing many layers of clothing, hiding household items among the layers of clothes to lighten their luggage.\\n The Price daughters – Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May – and their mother, Orleanna, and father, Nathan, attend their first church service in the village of Kilanga, and they realize how different their culture is from that of the Congo. For example, 14-year-old Leah helps her father plant a \\\"demonstration garden\\\"; it immediately receives criticism from Mama Tataba, whom the family has engaged as a live-in maid, and the garden does poorly due to the inappropriate climate. Nathan tries to hold an impromptu Easter celebration in hopes of baptizing numerous people, but he is unable to carry this out, as the river along the village, where he plans to hold the baptism, is infested with crocodiles.\\n Leah and her twin Adah begin to spy on Eeben Axelroot, the pilot who conveyed the family to Kilanga, and Nathan tries to convince Congolese men, one by one, to convert to Christianity. Meanwhile, five-year-old Ruth May befriends the village children. She finds out about Axelroot's business with the diamonds after breaking her arm.\\n After Mama Tataba departs, an orphan boy named Nelson becomes the family servant.

They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it--from garden seeds to Scripture--is calamitously transformed on African soil. What follows is a suspenseful epic of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in postcolonial Africa.\\n The novel is set against one of the most dramatic political chr"}, {"step": 2, "response": "The Belgian Congo became independent in 1960. \n\nThis can be inferred from the information provided, which mentions that \"The Poisonwood Bible\" is set in the Belgian Congo during the 1960s and that the Price family moved there in 1959.

Messi was also asked to go, but he didn't want to leave.” \\n Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger missed out on a number of top talents during his iconic 22-year reign with the Gunners, with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic also slipping his net. \\n Messi was, however, never a realistic option as Barcelona had invested plenty of funds and faith in the South American by the time Premier League suitors came onto the scene. \\n Arsenal’s former head of global recruitment, Francis Cagigao, told Goal recently: “We had identified Messi and we wouldn’t have been the only ones. \\n “I remember there were a couple of Italian clubs and obviously Spanish clubs who were very aware of Messi. \\n “But he couldn’t play national level because of the restriction on his status in the country at the time. He could only play regional games for Barcelona. \\n “So, yes, there were talks between myself and representatives, and we got a very good feeling that there was a possibility that the player would want to join us. \\n “But, once we’d delved into the situation and looked at it from a legal point of view, we very quickly saw that it actually couldn’t happen. It was impossible. So, that was discarded once we saw that.” \\n Messi saw a move to England mooted again during the summer of 2020, as he aired a desire to leave Barcelona, but the likes of Manchester City were ultimately left empty-handed as the 33-year-old revealed to Goal that he will be honouring the final year of his current contract.\",\n      \"image\": \"https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/bltad623f5e528d28d9/af34cdd1ad13dd959b4fb32abc0496f9b298123c.jpg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2020/09/21/5f68da0eca4741f27e8b457f.html\",\n      \"title\": \"Messi's former agent reveals he was tempted to join Arsenal\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2020/09/21/5f68da0eca4741f27e8b457f.html\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2020-09-21T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"MARCA\",\n      \"score\": 0.29605501890182495,\n      \"text\": \"FC Barcelona - La Liga \\nWhen the Gunners signed Fabregas\\n ES Actualizado \\n21/09/2020\\n-\\n 18:56\\n Lionel Messi 's former agent, Fabian Soldini , recalled the day that the Argentine forward came close to signing for Arsenal .

The executive departments are the administrative arms of the president of the United States . There are currently 15 executive departments.\\n \\n Each department is headed by a secretary whose title echoes the title of their respective department, with the exception of the Department of Justice , whose head is known as the attorney general . The heads of the executive departments are appointed by the president and take office after confirmation by the United States Senate , and serve at the pleasure of the president . The heads of departments are members of the Cabinet of the United States , an executive organ that normally acts as an advisory body to the president.

[ 1 ] President George Washington appointed Hamilton, born in Nevis in 1755 or in 1757, as the United States' first Secretary of the Treasury in 1789.

In the 20th century, nine foreign-born individuals were appointed to the cabinet, including German-born Oscar Straus and Mexican-born George Romney (George Romney, born to American parents, became the father of former Governor of Massachusetts , 2012 Republican U.S. presidential candidate and current U.S. Senator from Utah Mitt Romney .

The Department of Labor and the Department of the Interior follow with three, and the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and State have each had two. Former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright were the highest-ranking foreign-born cabinet members ever in accordance to the United States presidential line of succession .

The latest United States federal executive department as of August 4, 2024, is not explicitly mentioned in the search results.\n2. However, from the second search result about foreign-born United States Cabinet members, we can infer that the latest department might be one that has had foreign-born secretaries, such as the Department of the Treasury, Department of Labor, Department of the Interior, Department of Housing and Urban Development, or Department of State.\n\nTo directly answer the question about the birth state of the first secretary of the latest department, we need to identify which department was established most recently before August 4, 2024. The Department of Homeland Security is the most recent department created in 2002, but it's not mentioned in the context of foreign-born secretaries.\n\nGiven this gap in explicit information, let’s perform a more specific search:\n\n<WebSearch>first secretary of the latest United States federal executive department as of August 4 2024 birth state</WebSearch>", "search_query": "first secretary of the latest United States federal executive department as of August 4 2024 birth state", "search_result": "{\n  \"requestId\": \"86640f6c13d3b507a5874e607e5d5390\",\n  \"autopromptString\": \"first secretary of the latest United States federal executive department as of August 4 2024 birth state\",\n  \"resolvedSearchType\": \"neural\",\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q54860790\",\n      \"title\": \"Deb Haaland\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q54860790\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-04-06T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"score\": 0.3154175281524658,\n      \"text\": \"American politician (born 1960) Debra Anne Haaland Debra Anne \\\"Deb\\\" Haaland Debra Haaland \\n \\n edit \\n \\n \\n Language \\n Label \\n Description \\n Also known as \\n \\n \\n \\n default for all languages \\n No label defined \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n English \\n Deb Haaland \\n American politician (born 1960) \\n \\n Debra Anne Haaland Debra Anne \\\"Deb\\\" Haaland Debra Haaland \\n \\n \\n \\n Statements \\n Debra Anne Haaland (English) \\n \\n 4 references \\n \\n The Cabinet | The White House (English) \\n \\n Secretary of the Interior \\n \\n Identifiers \\n 1 reference \\n \\n Personality Database ™️ | Famous People and Characters | Personality Database ™️ 2022 (English)\",\n      \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Deb_Haaland%2C_official_portrait%2C_116th_Congress_%28cropped%29.jpg/960px-Deb_Haaland%2C_official_portrait%2C_116th_Congress_%28cropped%29.jpg\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://www.wikidata.org/static/apple-touch/wikidata.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q104244043\",\n      \"title\": \"Miguel Cardona\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q104244043\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-02-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"score\": 0.32165998220443726,\n      \"text\": \"American educator and politician (born 1975) Miguel Angel Cardona \\n \\n edit \\n \\n \\n Language \\n Label \\n Description \\n Also known as \\n \\n \\n \\n default for all languages \\n No label defined \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n English \\n Miguel Cardona \\n American educator and politician (born 1975) \\n \\n Miguel Angel Cardona \\n \\n \\n \\n Statements \\n instance of \\n \\n \\n human \\n \\n \\n 0 references \\n \\n \\n \\n image \\n \\n \\n Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, official portrait.jpg 2,400 × 3,000; 3.96 MB \\n \\n \\n 0 references \\n \\n \\n \\n sex or gender \\n \\n \\n male \\n \\n \\n 0 references \\n \\n \\n \\n country of citizenship \\n \\n \\n United States \\n \\n \\n 0 references \\n \\n \\n \\n given name \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Miguel \\n \\n \\n series ordinal \\n \\n 1 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 1 reference \\n \\n based on heuristic \\n inferred from person's full name \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Angel \\n \\n \\n series ordinal \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 0 references \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n family name \\n \\n \\n Cardona \\n \\n \\n 1 reference \\n \\n based on heuristic \\n inferred from person's full name \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n date of birth \\n \\n \\n \\n 11 July 1975 \\n \\n \\n \\n 0 references \\n \\n \\n \\n place of birth \\n \\n \\n Meriden \\n \\n \\n 1 reference \\n \\n imported from Wikimedia project \\n Polish Wikipedia \\n \\n Wikimedia import URL \\n https://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Miguel_Cardona&amp;oldid=61981692 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n occupation \\n \\n \\n \\n teacher \\n \\n \\n 0 references \\n \\n \\n \\n politician \\n \\n \\n 0 references \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n position held \\n \\n \\n \\n United States Secretary of Education \\n \\n \\n start time \\n \\n 2 March 2021 \\n \\n \\n series ordinal \\n \\n 12 \\n \\n \\n replaces \\n Betsy DeVos \\n \\n \\n \\n 2 references \\n \\n reference URL \\n https://www2.ed.gov/news/staff/bios/cardona.html \\n \\n retrieved \\n \\n 23 March 2021 \\n \\n \\n reference URL \\n https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/cabinet/ \\n \\n retrieved \\n \\n 26 July 2021 \\n \\n \\n title \\n \\n The Cabinet (English) \\n \\n \\n language of work or name \\n English \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n educated at \\n \\n \\n H.C.

It has these huge fangs, the whole front of the mouth is just giant teeth.” \\n “It’s a big predator, but potentially also a relatively slow ambush predator.” \\n The nearly complete skeleton of Gaiasia jennyae after preparation.

We were all very excited. \\n “After examining the skull, the structure of the front of the skull caught my attention.” \\n “It was the only clearly visible part at that time, and it showed very unusually interlocking large fangs, creating a unique bite for early tetrapods.” \\n “We had some really fantastic material, including a complete skull, that we could then use to compare with other animals from this age and get a sense of what this animal was and what makes it unique. It turns out, there’s a lot about the creature that makes it special,” Dr. Pardo added. \\n Gaiasia jennyae is related to extinct amphibian-like animals called colosteids (family Colosteidae ) that are more characteristic of an even earlier age and are thought to have been replaced by more modern amphibians and reptiles in the Late Carboniferous epoch, around 307 million years ago. \\n “There are some other more archaic animals still hanging on 300 million years ago, but they were rare, they were small, and they were doing their own thing,” Dr. Pardo said \\n “ Gaiasia jennyae is big, and it is abundant, and it seems to be the primary predator in its ecosystem.” \\n “It tells us that what was happening in the far south was very different f\",\n      \"image\": \"https://cdn.sci.news/images/2024/07/image_13074f-Gaiasia-jennyae.jpg\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://cdn.sci.news/favicon-32x32.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382987128_Giant_tetrapod_fossil_revises_extinction_era_and_broadens_range\",\n      \"title\": \"Giant tetrapod fossil revises extinction era and broadens range\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382987128_Giant_tetrapod_fossil_revises_extinction_era_and_broadens_range\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2024-08-08T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"text\": \"To read the full-text of this research, you can request a copy directly from the author.

[ 1 ] It is one of the oldest systems of local government in the Indian subcontinent, with historical mentions dating back to around 250 CE. [ 2 ] The word 'raj' means 'rule,' and panchayat' means 'assembly' ( ayat ) of 'five' ( panch ). Traditionally, panchayats consisted of wise and respected elders chosen and accepted by the local community. These assemblies resolved disputes between individuals and villages. However, there were various forms of such assemblies.\\n The leader of the panchayat was often called the president, mukhiya , sarpanch , or pradhan , which was an elected or generally acknowledged position. The modern panchayati raj system of India and its gram panchayats should not be confused with the traditional system or the extra-constitutional khap panchayats (or caste panchayats) found in parts of northern India. [ 3 ] \\n \\n Open Panchayat near Narsingarh, Madhya Pradesh \\n Mahatma Gandhi advocated for panchayat raj as the foundation of India's political system. It was envisioned as a decentralized form of government, where each village would be responsible for its own affairs. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] This vision was termed Gram Swaraj (\\\"village self-governance\\\"). While India developed a highly centralized system of government, [ 6 ] this has been moderated by delegating several administrative functions to the local level, thereby empowering elected gram panchayats. [ 7 ] \\n Jawaharlal Nehru inaugurated the panchayati raj system at Nagaur on 2 October 1959. The date was chosen to coincide with Mahatma Gandhi 's birthday. Gandhi envisioned Gram Swaraj through the panchayati raj system. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The system was later modified in 1992. [ 10 ] \\n \\n In the Indian subcontinent [ edit ] \\n The Hindu text Rigveda (1700 BCE) provides evidence suggesting that self-governing village bodies called sabhas existed. [ 11 ] Over time, these bodies evolved into panchayats (five-person councils). Panchayats were functional institutions of grassroots governance in almost every village. The village panchayat or elected council had significant powers, both executive and judicial. It distributed land, collected taxes from the produce, and paid the government's share on behalf of the village. Above these village councils, a larger panchayat or council existed to supervise and intervene if necessary.

His opponent is 27-year-old social media superstar Jake Paul . It's a fight unlike anything we've ever seen before. Anyone unfamiliar with these combatants would think that the man who's 30 years younger would have a massive advantage. After all, there has to be a reason that Tyson hasn't fought in nearly two decades, right? However, despite the age difference, many people are backing Tyson in this fight. The reputation he built up during his heyday has made him appear unbeatable to some, even as he approaches 60 years old. Here's a brief history of Mike Tyson's boxing career. Tyson's opponent: What to know about Jake Paul Where is Mike Tyson from? Tyson was born on June 30, 1966 in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York. His family hopped around a bit in Tyson's childhood. They lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant until Tyson was 10 years old, before financial burdens forced the family to move to Brownsville. Despite the constant change of scenery, Tyson and his family never left the New York City area. When did Mike Tyson start boxing? Although it's unclear exactly when Tyson picked up boxing, he dominated as an amateur before turning pro at 18. As an amateur, Tyson won gold medals at the Junior Olympic Games in 1981, defeating Joe Cortez, and 1982, defeating Kelton Brown. Tyson became a pro in 1986 at 18 years old. Tyson made his professional debut on March 6, 1985, where he defeated Hector Mercedes by first-round TKO. On Feb. 16, 1986, Tyson burst into the boxing spotlight after defeating Jesse Ferguson on national television. When did Tyson become champion? His first heavyweight title came after a second-round TKO victory over Trevor Berbick, earning him the WBC title and making him the youngest champion (20 years, 4 months) in history. To this day, he is still the youngest person ever to hold a heavyweight title. Tyson would go on to win multiple other heavyweight championships and became the first person in history to hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles simultaneously. Tyson was unbeatable in his early days, bursting out to a 37-0 start to his professional career with 33 of those victories via knockout. Did Tyson ever lose? Tyson's first loss was a shocker at the hands of Buster Douglas on Feb. 11, 1990. That defeat is still considered one of the biggest upsets in sports history. After losing to Douglas, Tyson won eight consecutive fights before losing back-to-back bouts to Evander Holyfield on Nov. 9, 1996 via 11th-round TKO and June 28, 1997 via disqualification. That second fight is when Tyson infamously bit Holyfield's ear twice, earning him the disqualification. Tyson fought only 10 more times following that bout. He went 5-3 with two no-contests in those matches. Tyson's arrest Tyson was arrested in July 1991 for the rape of 18-year-old Desiree Washington.

He also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club before his potential as a footballer won him a £6,500 move to Everton in January 1937. He went on to finish as the First Division 's top-scorer in 1938 and 1939 , helping Everton to finish as champions of the Football League in the latter campaign. League football was then suspended for seven full seasons due to the outbreak of war in Europe, during which time he scored 24 goals in 23 appearances for England whilst guesting for Everton and some other clubs. In November 1945, he moved to Chelsea for £14,000 and scored a club-record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season.\\n In November 1947, he made a surprise move to Third Division South club Notts County for a British record transfer fee of £20,000. He helped the club to win promotion as champions in 1949–50 before he moved on to Brentford in March 1952 for a club record £16,000. In January 1953, Brentford appointed him player-manager, though he would only remain in charge for nine months. He joined Arsenal as a player in November 1953 for £10,000, where he saw out the remainder of his playing career. Despite losing much of his best years to World War II , he scored 260 goals in 433 league and cup competitions in 14 full seasons in the Football League .\\n He had a promising start to his managerial career by leading Kettering Town to the Southern League title in 1956–57, but then only had two more seasons as manager, getting relegated with Notts County in 1957–58 and then relegated with Kettering Town in 1963–64. During the 1970s, he struggled with debt and related legal problems, which were reported in the media as an example of a celebrated person falling from grace.\\n He scored 22 goals in hi\",\n      \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Tommy_Lawton_%28ca.1951%29.jpg\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.stamford-bridge.com/player.php?id=324&surname=Lawton&firstname=Tommy\",\n      \"title\": \"Tommy Lawton | Chelsea FC Profile Page - Stamford-Bridge.com\",\n "}, {"step": 2, "response": "Based on the search results, we have some information about Tommy Lawton's career at Chelsea FC, but none of the provided snippets explicitly mention the squad number he wore during his time there.\n\nTo find this specific detail, we should conduct another targeted search.

In 1969 he was struck in the eye by a stink bomb thrown by a schoolboy. Wilson’s response was \\\"with an arm like that he ought to be in the English cricket XI″ \\n Harold Wilson, the son of a chemist and teacher, was born in Yorkshire during the First World War. In 1924, aged 8, he visited 10 Downing Street, which would eventually become his home. \\n He studied Modern History for a year before transferring to Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University, graduating with a first class BA. \\n The Labour politician entered Parliament in 1945 as MP for Ormskirk and later becoming MP for Huyton. In 1947, then Prime Minister Clement Attlee made Wilson President of the Board of Trade. Aged 31, he had become the youngest member of the Cabinet in the 20th century. \\n Under Hugh Gaitskell’s leadership of the Labour party, Wilson served as Shadow Chancellor from 1955 to 1961, then as Shadow Foreign Secretary from 1961 to 1963. After Gaitskell passed away suddenly, Wilson fought and won a leadership contest against George Brown and James Callaghan. As Labour leader, he won 4 of the 5 General Elections he contested, although this includes a minority government. \\n His first election victory on 15 October 1964 saw him win with a small majority of 4, which increased significantly to 98 after a second General Election on 31 March 1966. As Prime Minister from 1964 to 1970, his main plan was to modernise. He believed that he would be aided by the “white heat of the technological revolution”. His government supported backbench MPs in liberalising laws on censorship, divorce, abortion, and homosexuality, and he abolished capital punishment. Crucial steps were taken towards stopping discrimination against women and ethnic minorities, and Wilson’s government also created the Open University. \\n In comparison, his outlook on foreign affairs was less modernising. He wanted to maintain Britain’s world role by keeping the Commonwealth united and nurturing the Anglo-American alliance. For example, his approach to the Vietnam War saw him skilfully balance modernist ambitions with Anglo-American interests when, despite repeated American requests, he kept British troops out while still maintaining good relations. Wilson biographer Philip Ziegler characterises his role as “honest broker”. \\n However, he had to fundamentally reshape Britain’s world role after inheriting an overstretched military and a £400 million balance of payments deficit, which caused successive sterling crises. To resolve these 2 interlinked problems, Wilson launched a Defence Review (1964 to 1965) and created the Department for Economic Affairs, which sought to implement an ambitious National Plan. \\n When sterling crises continued, Wilson was forced to devalue the pound in November 1967.

It is the first entry for a Microsoft console in the franchise.\\n A demo of the title was made available to Xbox Live users on December 4, 2007. The demo includes two different pre-made card decks and supports both single player gameplay and local multiplayer for up to four players. [ 1 ] Initially released in Japan in 2006, the full game wasn't released in North America until more than a year later, in February 2008, but has never been released in Europe or Australia.\\n \\n As the game begins, the player-nameable \\\"Boy\\\" protagonist sells himself into slavery to help his struggling village. While departing the village with his new owner, the two encounter a mysterious woman carrying a deck of magical cards which respond powerfully to the young man's presence. As the woman, Princess Faustina, pleads with the slaver to release the boy (whom she refers to as \\\"the savior\\\"), all three are set upon by Rilara, a traveling bandit. It is here that the young man, controlled by the player, learns that he is actually a Cepter, a powerful individual who can control magical cards. Using cards borrowed from Faustina, he defeats Rilara and begins his journey towards becoming a master Cepter.\\n The protagonist is sold by the slaver to an arena, and must fight other Cepters to earn his freedom. When he finally does, Faustina takes him to her home, the Advatarian Empire. Her father tells her to go to the four neighboring elementally-themed lands and negotiate for peace. However, after they finish doing this, it is revealed that the king only did it as a ploy to launch an all-out attack. The protagonist must flee along with Faustina to avoid execution. Soon after, Faustina is kidnapped by High Priest Sapphius, one of the world's most powerful Cepters, who seeks to destroy the Empire and the world.\\n Too weak to resist the High Priest, the protagonist is forced to undergo the Trials, an ancient proving grounds for Cepters overseen by Diarna, a former Imperial knight who became a hermit. He passes them, despite the interference of Rilara, and becomes a true Cepter, learning that a Cepter's purpose is to reassemble the cards into Culdcept, the book of creation. Meanwhile, the High Priest attacks and destroys the Empire. The protagonist can choose to travel to the Northern or Southern Continent to face the High Priest, but, each time, Faustina perishes, either by the hand of the High Priest or his own. Both times, he reassembles Culdcept, and is granted the power of a god by the world's goddess Zeromn, but he choos\",\n      \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e8/Culdcept_Saga.jpg\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"http://culdceptcentral.com/culdcept-saga/culdcept-saga-guides/471-cs360-guides-producersblog\",\n      \"title\": \"Culdcept Saga Producer's Blog\",\n      \"url\": \"http://culdceptcentral.com/culdcept-saga/culdcept-saga-guides/471-cs360-guides-producersblog\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"text\": \"Please wait while your request is being verified...\",\n      \"favicon\": \"data:,\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.mobygames.com/game/33669/culdcept-saga/\",\n      \"title\": \"Culdcept Saga (2008) - MobyGames\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.mobygames.com/game/33669/culdcept-saga/\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2008-02-05T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"text\": \"Culdcept Saga is a Magic / Monopoly -style video game in the Culdcept game series .\\nGameplay is similar to previous instalments.

However, Niki Lauda is Austrian, not Italian. Another prominent driver is **Clay Regazzoni**, who is Swiss, and then there’s **Gilles Villeneuve** (Canadian) and **Michele Alboreto** (Italian). Michele Alboreto seems like the most likely candidate here.\n\n2. **Shares a last name with a common cocktail drink**: The last name \"Alboreto\" doesn’t seem to match any common cocktail names. However, considering other Italian drivers, **Nigel Mansell** (British) doesn't fit, but **Alberto Ascari** could be relevant if we stretch associations. But none of these directly relate to cocktails either. \n\n   However, the **Negroni** is a famous Italian cocktail, and \"Negroni\" sounds similar to **\"Alessandro Nannini\"**, an Italian driver whose sister, **Gianna Nannini**, is a famous singer. Yet, Alessandro Nannini didn’t drive the Ferrari 312T.\n\n3. **Nephew of the Italian racing driver**: If we consider **Michele Alboreto**, his nephew would be **Christian Pinasco**, but he wasn't involved in F1 during 1994. \n\nGiven the complexity of the question and earlier search errors, let’s refine our search:\n\n<WebSearch>1994 Formula One car driven by nephew of Italian racing driver Ferrari 312T Negroni</WebSearch>", "search_query": "1994 Formula One car driven by nephew of Italian racing driver Ferrari 312T Negroni", "search_result": "Error performing web search for '1994 Formula One car driven by nephew of Italian racing driver Ferrari 312T Negroni': "}, {"step": 5, "response": "<WebSearch>1994 Formula One car nephew Italian racing driver Ferrari 312T Negroni</WebSearch>", "search_query": "1994 Formula One car nephew Italian racing driver Ferrari 312T Negroni", "search_result": "Error performing web search for '1994 Formula One car nephew Italian racing driver Ferrari 312T Negroni': "}, {"step": 5, "response": "Reached maximum number of steps without finding an answer.", "is_correct": false, "ground_truth": "None", "all_completion_tokens": 845, "all_prompt_tokens": 1401, "time_cost": 338.1544759273529}]}
