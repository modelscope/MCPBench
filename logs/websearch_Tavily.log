【字体：大 中 小】 4月8日，西南地区最大直径单护盾岩石掘进机（TBM）“福和号”在四川省德阳市顺利下线。该设备是针对香炉山隧洞特殊地质条件量身定制的“国之重器”，将用于云南省滇中引水工程大理I段香炉山隧洞6#施工支洞施工建设，为解决香炉山隧洞建设“卡脖子”难题提供强劲动力，标志着工程向“引水润滇”的目标迈出了关键一步。 据了解，“福和号”TBM是目前滇中引水工程建设中运用的最大直径单护盾岩石掘进机，设计开挖直径达10.23米，总长约190米，包含主机、1节设备桥以及10节后配套拖车。TBM整机重量2500吨，最大总推力156728千牛，总装机功率约10000千瓦。目前，“福和号”TBM已完成全部设备的组装调试工作，计划于2025年5月前运抵现场组装洞，并启动现场组装工作。 “福和号”TBM计划掘进总长度15.51千米，其中香炉山隧洞6#施工支洞下坡掘进约5.88千米，最大坡度达8.92%。为应对香炉山隧洞6#支洞及其主洞上游控制段大直径、长距离独头掘进，软岩大变形、断层破碎带、长距离高承压富水洞段大坡度下坡掘进等施工难点，“福和号”TBM在设计上，采取了联络阶段针对性配置双速减速机、高压辅助脱困系统、同步推拼系统、高效管片吊运系统、可伸缩式集渣斗、底部辅助排渣螺机等措施，首次搭载锚索钻机系统，极大提升了TBM在本项目复杂地质条件的适应性，为隧洞安全高效施工保驾护航。 滇中引水工程是国务院确定的172项节水供水重大水利工程中的标志性工程，也是中国西南地区规模最大、投资最多的水资源配置工程，是我国在建最大引水工程。工程完工后，受水区共涉及输水总干渠沿线6个州（市）的34个受水小区，受益国土面积达3.69万平方公里，直接受益人口达1100多万人。 香炉山隧洞作为控制滇中引水工程整体工期的关键性工程，是目前国内已建、在建和近期拟建深埋长引水隧洞中地质条件最复杂的工程。经过5年建设，香炉山隧洞活动断裂、高地应力、高外水压力、软岩破碎带等特殊不良地质条件下的设计施工难题已充分暴露，“卡脖子”问题日益突出，地质条件复杂性、应对措施艰巨性前所未有。为制造出一台适用于香炉山隧洞上游控制段稳步掘进的TBM掘进机，以中国工程院院士杜彦良为首的滇中引水工程专家委员会委员及特邀专家，组成课题研制组进行了10余次专题研究。按照参建单位及专家意见，根据工程地质实际情况，中铁隧道局集团和中铁装备集团联合科学研判TBM的适应性、科学决策TBM改造、科学制定TBM掘进方案，最终为攻克香炉山隧洞上游控制段掘进地质“量身打造”了“福和号”TBM。 下一步，香炉山建设责任将进一步压实，一手抓钻爆法隧洞掘进工作，一手抓TBM工地组装工作，持续掀起滇中引水工程“百日攻坚”立功竞赛活动高潮，为早日完成洞穿香炉山的目标而不懈努力，为云南人民交上一份满意的答卷。

2025-04-09 19:29:04 来源: 科技日报 点击数： 科技日报记者 赵汉斌 通讯员 杨良荣 冶志伟 记者从中铁隧道局集团获悉，由该集团与中铁装备集团联合研制的西南地区最大直径单护盾硬岩掘进机（TBM）“福和号”，于4月8日在四川德阳正式下线。该设备将投入云南滇中引水工程大理I段香炉山隧洞6#施工支洞建设，为破解滇中地区水资源短缺难题提供关键装备支撑。 “福和号”TBM设计开挖直径达10.23米，整机长190米、重2500吨，具备最大推力156728千牛和总装机功率10000千瓦的技术参数，是目前国内同类型设备中的顶尖产品。针对香炉山隧洞复杂地质条件，该设备创新集成双速减速机、高压辅助脱困系统、同步推拼装置等多项关键技术，可有效应对软岩大变形、断层破碎带及高承压富水洞段施工挑战。特别搭载的超前数字钻机与锚索钻机系统，实现了掌子面超前地质预报、加固及拱顶锚索支护功能一体化，为长距离大坡度隧洞施工提供安全保障。 滇中引水工程作为国务院确定的172项节水供水重大水利工程标志性项目，线路总长664公里，其中隧洞占比超92%。工程建成后将年均调水34亿立方米，惠及昆明、玉溪等6州市34个受水区，直接受益人口超1100万。“福和号”承担的香炉山隧洞6#支洞施工任务全长15.51公里，最大坡度达8.92%，其成功研制标志着滇中引水工程关键控制性节点取得重大突破。 中铁隧道局项目负责人表示，设备计划于2025年5月前完成现场组装调试，届时将开启国内大直径TBM在复杂地质条件下施工的新篇章。该设备的投用不仅填补了西南地区超大直径硬岩掘进装备空白，更为我国高难度水工隧洞建设积累了宝贵经验。 （受访单位供图） 责任编辑：王倩 相关稿件： 热点 一日三试，均获成功！ 今年全国快递业务量已突破500亿件 开放赋能 消费升级——海南国际旅游消费中心建设“热力足”
