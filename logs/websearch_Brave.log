However, his total league appearances are not explicitly stated in the provided information. Further searching is required to find this data.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Team with the Original Name Shared by a Bird Impressionist\nThe \"bird impressionist\" clue likely refers to someone famous for mimicking birds, such as John James Audubon (known for his bird paintings) or a performer like Charlie Chaplin (who sometimes imitated birds in his routines). However, the phrase \"original name\" suggests a historical figure whose name matches a football team's early identity.\n\nA prominent example is \"The Robins,\" the original nickname of Tranmere Rovers. This name could be linked to bird impressionists metaphorically or historically. If this is correct, the team in question is Tranmere Rovers.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Derek Smith's Appearances for Tranmere Rovers\nWe need specific data on how many league appearances Derek Smith made for Tranmere Rovers.
