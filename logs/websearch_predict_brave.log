Then, we determine how many of those blue moons fell on the 31st day of the month.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n- **Blue Moon Definition**: A blue moon is the second full moon in a calendar month. This happens because the lunar cycle is approximately 29.5 days, meaning a month with 30 or 31 days can occasionally have two full moons.\n- **Pruett Rule**: This refers to the modern definition of a blue moon as the second full moon in a single calendar month, which was popularized by an error in a 1946 article by James Pruett in *Sky & Telescope* magazine.\n- **Timeframe**: We are looking at full moons from July 28, 1914, to September 2, 1945.\n\n### Step 2: Collecting Full Moon Data\nFrom the search results, we have access to full moon calendars for 1914 and 1945:\n- **Full Moon Calendar 1914**: Provides exact dates and times of full moons in 1914.\n- **Full Moon Calendar 1945**: Provides exact dates and times of full moons in 1945.\n- **General Full Moon Calendar 1900–2050**: Lists all full moons during this period, allowing us to extract data for 1914–1945.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Blue Moons\nTo identify blue moons, we need:\n1.

An astronomical season typically has three full moons, so the extra one is considered the \"blue moon.\"\n\n2. **Identify Full Moon Dates**:\n   - We already have a list of full moon dates between 1914 and 1945 from previous searches.\n\n3. **Determine Seasons with Four Full Moons**:\n   - Astronomical seasons begin with the solstices and equinoxes:\n     - Spring: March 20/21\n     - Summer: June 20/21\n     - Fall: September 22/23\n     - Winter: December 21/22\n   - For each season, count the number of full moons. If there are four full moons in a season, the third one is a \"blue moon.\"\n\n4. **Check if the Blue Moon Falls on the 31st**:\n   - After identifying the blue moons, check if any of them occurred on the 31st of the month.\n\n---\n\n### Search Steps Already Taken:\n- The search for \"full moon dates between 1914 and 1945\" provided detailed calendars of full moon occurrences during this period.\n- The search for \"blue moons between 1914 and 1945 occurring on the 31st\" yielded general information about blue moons but did not directly answer the question.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo proceed, we need to:\n1. Identify all astronomical seasons between 1914 and 1945.\n2. Count the full moons in each season to find seasons with four full moons.\n3. Determine which of these blue moons occurred on the 31st.\n\nSince the exact dates and analysis are not yet available, we need to refine our search further.\n\n---\n\n### Refined Search Query:\n<WebSearch>full moon calendar 1914 to 1945 with dates and times</WebSearch>", "search_query": "full moon calendar 1914 to 1945 with dates and times", "search_result": "Title: Full moon calendar 1900-2050 * fullmoon.info\nDescription: The <strong>full</strong> <strong>moon</strong> <strong>calendar</strong> 1900-2050150 years of data in an overview There are exactly 1,867 <strong>full</strong> <strong>moons</strong> between 1900 and 2050.

A season usually has three full moons, but occasionally, due to the lunar cycle, there can be four.\n   \n2. **Time Period**: The period in question spans from the start of World War I (July 28, 1914) to the end of World War II (September 2, 1945).\n\n3. **Search Results**:\n   - We have search results listing all full moon dates between 1914 and 1945.\n   - We also have specific information about what constitutes a \"blue moon,\" both by the Pruett rule and the more commonly known definition (the second full moon in a calendar month).\n   - There are mentions of blue moons occurring on the 31st, but no definitive list within our specified time frame.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The Pruett rule defines a blue moon differently than the more popular \"second full moon in a calendar month\" definition. Therefore, identifying these moons requires determining which seasons had four full moons and then isolating the third one.\n- The search results indicate several resources that list full moon dates and times between 1914 and 1945, such as fullmoon.info and phasesmoon.com.\n- However, none of these directly provide counts or occurrences of blue moons by the Pruett rule specifically on the 31st.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven the above points, it seems necessary to pinpoint the exact dates of blue moons under the Pruett rule during the specified period. Since the available data does not explicitly state this, further web searching is required.\n\n### Output:\n<WebSearch>blue moons by Pruett rule between 1914 and 1945 occurring on the 31st</WebSearch>", "search_query": "blue moons by Pruett rule between 1914 and 1945 occurring on the 31st", "search_result": "Title: Blue moon - Wikipedia\nDescription: A <strong>blue</strong> <strong>moon</strong> refers either to the presence of a second full <strong>moon</strong> in a calendar month, to the third full <strong>moon</strong> in a season containing four, or to a <strong>moon</strong> that appears <strong>blue</strong> due to atmospheric effects.
